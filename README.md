## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Even though this project is very simple, it gave me the momentum to start working solo, which I think is terrifying for every novice developer. Now I feel much more confident that I can finish any project I intend to take.
Besides that, it helped me hone my HTML and CSS skills, which are always secondary on my studying hours in comparison with JS and React.

### Continued development

After having this positive experience, now I intend to take on challenges more in accordante with my programming knowledge. Even though I am really gratefull that project helped me lose the fear I had on working on my own, it felt below my league, especially the logical part of it, like setting functions, useState, props, etc. I will start something more ambitious now.
